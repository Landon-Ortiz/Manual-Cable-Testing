<h1> Programming Cable Pins</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I developed programs to configure cable test pins in alignment with schematics for CAMI and CIRRIS projects. This involved:

- **Creating Pin Maps**: Designing new pin configurations to match detailed schematics and ensure accurate signal routing.
- **Developing Connector Maps**: Mapping connectors to correspond with specific application requirements and standards.
- **Configuring Electrical Settings**: Setting parameters for Ohms, voltage, insulation resistance, and ramp-up speed to meet precise electrical specifications.
- **Ensuring Compliance**: Aligning all configurations with standards from **NASA**, **IPC**, **Blue Origin**, and various customer-specific requirements.

By automating the configuration of cable test pins and meticulously mapping connectors, the program ensures that all cable assemblies adhere to stringent electrical standards, enhancing reliability and performance for high-stakes applications.
